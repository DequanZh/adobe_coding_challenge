Run "python3 dedup_records.py {input_file}" to generate two files, one is the deduplicated file with deduplicated records and other one is the corresponding change log. input_file should be in the same directory as the python script.

To run the example file, run "python3 dedup_records.py leads.json" to get leads_deduplicated_records.json and leads_change_log as output.
